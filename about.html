          <p class="w3-justify"><em>a-font-of-type.js</em> was born from a beginner's perspective. Barely a month into working at Skeuomorph Press, I threw out an idea, and it's been tugging at me ever since.<br>
            I spent most of my time setting and redistributing type- both for usefulness' sake and to better learn the layout of the California case. Picking this up didn't take long, but impatient as I am, I developed a strategy to increase my efficiency. I noticed each individual word had a distinct path. By memorizing the pathway of the letters 't,' 'h,' and 'e' through the case, I was able to redistribute the entire word 'the' from memory- as one sequence of movements- rather than searching around for each individual letter. Pulling back, then, I realized that each word's pattern would be strung together by spacing, also present within the job case. If words could be mapped, so could sentences - so could entire texts.<br>
            From a pencil sketch on tracing paper to an interactive program in JavaScript, I've found this visualization striking at every stage of development. What began as an artistic concept has evolved into a fascinating lens through which aspects of typesetting and text continue to surface. These graphs contain the movements of countless individuals, serving to visualize the typographical DNA which composes a text. I experience hand-setting established content as an echo - as I move, so too did Whitman, so too did the individual setting the next edition of Whitman. This experience is made accessible to those not physically involved by the visualization of said movement. <br>
            In a way, this project falls under preservation. Human movement through space is ultimately intangible- instantly carried away by time. I'm not certain which atoms I disturbed in my linoleum floor when I made my coffee this morning, and I'll never have a way of knowing.This visualization retrieves this information, serving as a preservation of the lines humans carve through space. <br>
            I'm also struck by how this changes my notion of text itself - hand-set texts contain both the journey and the destination. This imaging maps a text's journey through a California case, but the text itself is what contains these points, their ordering. The text serves as the function, the case as the coordinate system. The text is a map of the humans who composed it. <em>a-font-of-type.js</em> merely brings this latent content to the surface. <br>
